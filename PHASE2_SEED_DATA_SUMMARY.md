3. Explore interventions by theme, country, or workstream
4. Show theory of change in ToR objectives
5. Demonstrate indicator tracking and evidence linkage
6. Review risk management across portfolio

### For User Testing
- Use diverse intervention set to test all system features
- Validate workflow from ToR creation → Approval → Assignment → Results
- Test filtering and search across expanded dataset
- Verify dashboard aggregations with larger data volume
- Check export functionality with comprehensive data

### For Future Phases
- This seed data provides template for real Phase 2 interventions
- Theory of change format can be standardized
- Partner types and expertise areas can be expanded
- Evidence-based design approach can be institutionalized
- Geographic coverage framework can be maintained

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive Phase 2 seed data enhancement with:
